# VisionAid – Personalized Voice Assistance for the Visually Impaired

## Project Description

**VisionAid** is a personalized, voice-enabled assistive system designed to help **visually impaired users** understand and navigate their surroundings safely.  
The system uses **voice interaction, camera-based scene understanding, AI reasoning, and contextual memory** to provide **short, actionable, and accessibility-focused guidance**.

Unlike generic voice assistants, VisionAid prioritizes:
- Navigation safety
- Obstacle awareness
- Direction-based guidance
- Minimal and meaningful responses

---

##  Project Objectives

- Help visually impaired users understand **what is in front of them**
- Provide **clear movement guidance** (front / left / right)
- Avoid unnecessary visual descriptions (colors, decorations, artwork)
- Maintain contextual memory for follow-up questions
- Deliver calm, concise, and assistive voice responses

##  How the System Works

1. The system listens for a **wake word** (e.g., *Alexa*).
2. The user speaks a query.
3. The system identifies whether the query requires **vision-based understanding**.
4. If required, a real-time image is captured using the camera.
5. Past relevant interactions are retrieved using **semantic memory**.
6. The query and image are sent to a **vision-capable AI model**.
7. The system generates an **accessibility-focused response**.
8. The response is spoken aloud using **Google Text-to-Speech**.
9. The interaction is stored in a local database.
